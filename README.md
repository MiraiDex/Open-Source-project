# Welcome to my mmorpg style journey.


Hi, i'm MiraiDex.
Here i will tell you my steps from creating a mmorpg game from stratch.
There's going to be all the information you need in this development sessions.
This will be updated forever when i finished the whole pack for the game that i will upload.
This game is licenced and feel free to use my non-licences work!
Also, there is going to be tutorials so you can follow the steps i did in the Unity project.

# My story of the game:

From now i will get to a point that i love to make progress and make a solution for yourself.
This is going to be a awesome journey for me into the game development source all around the world.
I see many Youtube videos myself for creating a mmorpg list that is very unlikey and not to follow.
I will make content for this mmorpg game in tutorials and tips and tricks.
If you want to donate there is going to be a link down here.

# My goal for doing this first step:

My limit and skyrocketing high!
There is going to be a time that it takes months to practice and study and learn before getting it to github.
Sometimes i will post several times more and sometimes i dont and make choices for good content and quality.
The limit of the game would be endless and want to make clear that i wont rush anytime i go on the project.

# Take the development to a next level:

I hope you learn my skill to make the ability to make a change in the mmorpg history.
Everyone gets a chance for learning a skill in unity from every game you can expect.

Thanks for coming by on the mmorpg github repository
Best wishes and goodluck!
Thanks a lot!

MiraiDex.
